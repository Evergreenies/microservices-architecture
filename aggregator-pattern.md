## Microservices Design Patterns: Integration Patterns

### 2\. Aggregator Pattern ðŸ”—

  * **What it is:** The **Aggregator Pattern** is an **integration pattern** where a **service** (the aggregator) receives a request, dispatches it to multiple internal **microservices**, collects their responses, combines or transforms these responses, and then returns a single, cohesive response to the client. It's used when a client needs data that spans across several distinct **microservices**.

  * **How it works:**

    1.  A client sends a request to the **Aggregator service**.
    2.  The **Aggregator service** receives the request and, based on its logic, determines which other **microservices** it needs to call to gather all necessary data.
    3.  It dispatches concurrent requests to these multiple backend **microservices** (often using **synchronous communication** but can also leverage **asynchronous** calls internally).
    4.  It waits for responses from all (or a critical subset of) the invoked **microservices**.
    5.  Once all required data is received, the **Aggregator service** combines, filters, transforms, and possibly enriches the data into a single, unified response format.
    6.  Finally, it sends this aggregated response back to the original client.

        | Request (e.g., Get Product Page Data)
        V
+-------------------------------------------------+
|               [ Aggregator Service ]            |
|               (e.g., ProductView Service)       |
|  - Receives client request                      |
|  - Calls multiple backend services concurrently |
|  - Collects & Combines responses                |

**Explanation of the Markdown Diagram:**

  * **Web Client:** The consumer that needs aggregated data.
  * **Aggregator Service:** The central **service** responsible for making calls to other **microservices**, collecting their data, and composing the final response.
  * **Service A, B, C:** Backend **microservices** that provide specific pieces of data needed by the **Aggregator**.

  * **Simple Example: E-commerce Product Details Page**
    When a customer views a product page on an e-commerce website, the page typically displays:

      * Basic product information (name, description, price)
      * Customer reviews and ratings
      * Current stock availability

    In a **microservices** architecture:

    1.  The `Web Client` (browser) requests the product details for `Product ID: 123` from an `Aggregator Service` (e.g., `ProductView Service`).
    2.  The `ProductView Service` then makes several concurrent calls:
          * To `Product Service` for basic product info.
          * To `Review Service` for customer reviews.
          * To `Inventory Service` for stock availability.
    3.  It collects all three responses.
    4.  It combines this data (e.g., merges them into a JSON object) and sends the complete product details back to the `Web Client`.

    This allows the client to make a single request instead of multiple calls, simplifying client-side logic.

  * **AWS Services for Aggregator Pattern:**

      * **AWS Lambda:** Ideal for implementing lightweight **Aggregator services** that fan out requests and combine results. Its concurrency capabilities are well-suited.
      * **Amazon EC2** / **Amazon ECS** / **Amazon EKS:** For more complex **Aggregator services** that might require dedicated compute resources or container orchestration.
      * **Amazon API Gateway:** Often sits in front of the **Aggregator service**. While **API Gateway** itself can do basic aggregation/composition (especially with **Lambda** integrations), for complex logic involving multiple backend calls and transformations, a dedicated **Aggregator service** behind **API Gateway** is usually preferred.
      * **AWS Step Functions:** Can be used to orchestrate the calls to multiple backend **services** within a complex **Aggregator service**, especially if there's sequential logic or error handling needed between the calls.

### Advantages (Pros):

  * **Simplifies Client Logic:** Clients make a single request to the **Aggregator service** instead of multiple requests to different **microservices**.
  * **Reduced Network Latency:** Fewer network round trips between the client and backend **services**.
  * **Improved User Experience:** Can lead to faster loading times for complex views.
  * **Loose Coupling (for clients):** Clients are decoupled from the internal structure of backend **microservices** and their individual **APIs**.
  * **Security:** Backend **microservices** can be hidden from direct client access.

-----

### Disadvantages (Cons):

  * **Increased Complexity (for aggregator):** The **Aggregator service** itself becomes more complex, responsible for orchestrating multiple calls, handling partial failures, and managing timeouts.
  * **Potential Bottleneck:** The **Aggregator service** can become a **bottleneck** if it's not well-optimized or struggles with concurrency.
  * **Single Point of Failure:** If the **Aggregator service** fails, it can impact multiple features that rely on its combined data.
  * **Over-fetching/Under-fetching:** The aggregator might fetch more data than a specific client needs or might not fetch enough, requiring further design adjustments.
