## What are Microservices?

Microservices architecture is a way to build applications by breaking them into **small, independent services**. Each service handles a specific business function.

Imagine building a car. Instead of one giant factory making every single part and assembling it all at once (a **monolith**), you have separate, specialized workshops: one for engines, one for seats, one for tires. Each workshop (a **microservice**) works independently and then the parts come together.

**Key Idea:** Each microservice is like a tiny, self-contained application.

## Why Microservices?

Organizations choose microservices for several key benefits:

1.  **Scalability:** If the "engine" workshop gets busy, you can just add more "engine" workshops without affecting the "seat" or "tire" workshops. This means you can scale parts of your application that are under high demand, saving resources.
2.  **Resilience:** If the "seat" workshop has a problem, the "engine" and "tire" workshops can keep working. A failure in one microservice doesn't necessarily bring down the whole application.
3.  **Faster Development & Deployment:** Small teams can work on different services simultaneously. Since each service is independent, new features or fixes can be deployed quickly without affecting the rest of the application.
4.  **Flexibility:** Each service can use the best technology (programming language, database) for its specific job. You're not stuck with one technology for everything.

## How to Implement Microservices?

Implementing microservices involves several practices:

1.  **Decomposition:** Break your application into services based on **business capabilities**. For example, in an e-commerce app, you'd have services for "Order Management," "User Accounts," "Product Catalog," etc.
2.  **Communication:** Services talk to each other using simple methods, often through **APIs** (like a standard way for workshops to exchange parts). This can be direct (synchronous) or through messages (asynchronous).
3.  **Data Management:** Each service typically has its own **database**. This keeps services independent and avoids one central database becoming a bottleneck.
4.  **Deployment:** Use tools like **containers** (e.g., Docker) to package each service, and **orchestration platforms** (e.g., Kubernetes) to manage and run them efficiently.
5.  **Observability:** Since you have many services, you need good **monitoring** and **logging** to understand how they are performing and to quickly find issues.

### Key Terms (Reference)

* **Monolith:** A traditional application built as a single, unified unit where all components are tightly coupled.
* **Service:** A small, independent program that performs a specific function within a larger application.
* **Business Capability:** A distinct function or set of functions that a business performs (e.g., processing orders, managing customer data).
* **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules and definitions that allows different software components to communicate with each other. It defines how one service can request functionality from another.
* **Database:** An organized collection of data. In microservices, each service often has its own dedicated database.
* **Container:** A lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application (code, runtime, system tools, libraries, settings). Docker is a popular containerization platform.
* **Orchestration Platform:** Software that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes is the most widely used orchestration platform.
* **Monitoring:** The process of collecting and analyzing data about the performance and health of your services.
* **Logging:** The process of recording events and activities within your services, useful for debugging and auditing.
